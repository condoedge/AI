# Usage & Extension

This track walks you through consuming the package (AI facade, ingestion workflows, context retrieval) and extending it with your own models, scopes, and integration layers.

## Audience

- Product engineers embedding natural-language querying into apps
- Backend teams maintaining ingestion pipelines
- Developers curious about extending providers, hooks, or UI adapters

## Highlights

- **Quick Start** – Ship your first natural-language question in ~5 minutes.
- **API Surfaces** – AI facade, `AiManager`, and granular services for ingestion, context, embeddings, and LLM I/O.
- **Extensibility** – Override auto-discovery, inject custom providers, or plug into Laravel jobs/queues.
- **Quality Gates** – Testing recipes, observability hooks, and troubleshooting flows focused on runtime behavior (not just install).
